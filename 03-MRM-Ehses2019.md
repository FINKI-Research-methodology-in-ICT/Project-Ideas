# PROJECT: MRM paper - Ehses et al. 2019

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
### Aim
Create an interactive Jupyter Notebook that supplements a paper in the journal called Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, titled "Whole‐brain B1‐mapping using three‐dimensional DREAM" by authors Philipp Ehses, Daniel Brenner, Rüdiger Stirnberg, Eberhard D. Pracht, and Tony Stöcker.

### Type	
* [x] Educational document (i.e. interactive tutorial) 
* [x] Supplementary material for a published paper  
* [x] Research report 
  * [x] Includes data 
  * [ ] Includes simulations
  * [x] Includes analytical equations 
  * [ ] Includes statistical analyses
  * [ ] Re-generates already existing figures 
  * [x] Makes use of open-source software 
  * [x] Makes use of open-source scripts

### Topic
Quantitative B1 mapping MRI (B1: radiofrequency field amplitude, MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging)

### Keywords 
B1 mapping, flip angle, high‐field MRI, parallel transmission

### Resources
* Paper
  * https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27773
* Source code & data
  * https://gitlab.com/pehses/3dream-example

### Additional tools

* [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly)
* [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/)
* [Jupyter Book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html)

## Pros & Challenges   

### Pros
* Completely NeuroLibre/MyBinder compatible
* Already includes a Jupyter Notebook as an example

### Cons
* Code and script do not reproduce any figures from the paper

### Challenges
* Will need to create a GitLab account to access code & data

## TENTATIVE EXPECTATIONS  

Using the code, data, and scripts supplied by the authors of this journal paper, create a Jupyter Notebook that supplements the paper using NeuroLibre or MyBinder. Some text between the figures should be present (either for explanations or to transition between figures). Additionally, figures should have the 
added feature of being interactive using Plot.ly. Lastly, the Jupyter Notebook should be exported into a clean HTML format, either using the native SoS export to HTML feature or Jupyter Book.

## YOUR REPOSITORY MUST HAVE 
* LICENSE 
* README
* Configuration files or Dockerfile 
* .gitignore
* Setup instructions
* … 

## YOUR REPOSITORY SHOULD NOT HAVE 
* Binary data (simple png files etc are OK) 
* Output html figures > 1MB 

You can upload such files to a public OSF repo (having the exact same name with your GitHub repo) and download them to your environment.
