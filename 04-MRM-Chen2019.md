# PROJECT: MRM paper - Chen & Wu 2019

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION 
### Aim
Create an interactive Jupyter Notebook that supplements a paper in the journal called Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, titled "The use of Fourier‐domain analyses for unwrapping phase images of low SNR" by authors Nan‐kuei Chen and Pei‐Hsin Wu
.

### Type	
* [x] Educational document (i.e. interactive tutorial) 
* [x] Supplementary material for a published paper  
* [x] Research report 
  * [x] Includes data 
  * [ ] Includes simulations
  * [x] Includes analytical equations 
  * [ ] Includes statistical analyses
  * [ ] Re-generates already existing figures 
  * [x] Makes use of open-source software 
  * [x] Makes use of open-source scripts

### Topic
MRI Phase unwrapping (MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Phase: the phase of the complex MRI signal)

### Keywords 
Field inhomogeneities, Fourier‐domain analysis, MRI, phase unwrapping

### Resources
* Paper
  * https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.27719
* Source code & data
  * https://github.com/nankueichen/Fourier_space_phase_unwrapping 

### Additional tools

* [Plot.ly](https://plot.ly)
* [SoS](https://vatlab.github.io/)
* [Jupyter Book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html)

## Pros & Challenges   

### Pros
* Completely NeuroLibre compatible

### Cons
* Doesn’t reproduce all the papers figures.
* Very simple example.
* Only produces one figure.

### Challenges
* Uses the Julia programming language (an open-source relative to MATLAB)

## TENTATIVE EXPECTATIONS  

Using the code, data, and scripts supplied by the authors of this journal paper, create a Jupyter Notebook that supplements the paper using NeuroLibre or MyBinder. Some text between the figures should be present (either for explanations or to transition between figures). Additionally, figures should have the 
added feature of being interactive using Plot.ly. Lastly, the Jupyter Notebook should be exported into a clean HTML format, either using the native SoS export to HTML feature or Jupyter Book.

## YOUR REPOSITORY MUST HAVE 
* LICENSE 
* README
* Configuration files or Dockerfile 
* .gitignore
* Setup instructions
* … 

## YOUR REPOSITORY SHOULD NOT HAVE 
* Binary data (simple png files etc are OK) 
* Output html figures > 1MB 

You can upload such files to a public OSF repo (having the exact same name with your GitHub repo) and download them to your environment.
